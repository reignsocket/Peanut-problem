Problem Description  
Mr. Robinson has a pet monkey named Durto. On this day, the two of them were walking along the country road, and suddenly found a small note on the roadside sign: "Welcome to taste my peanuts for free! - Bear".
Mr. Robinson and a lot of people are very happy, because peanuts are their favorite. Behind the signboard, there is really a piece of peanut field on the roadside, and the peanut plants are neatly arranged in a rectangular grid (Figure 1). A lot of experience can tell at a glance how much peanuts are in each peanut plant. In order to train a lot of arithmetic, Mr. Robinson said: "You first find the plant with the most peanuts, pick the peanuts; then find the most peanuts in the remaining plants, pick the peanuts; and so on. , but you must return to the roadside within my limited time.
